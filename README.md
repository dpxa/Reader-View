# Reader-view

# WIP

This project will serve as a platform that is targeted for those that read pdfs and want to bookmark or markup parts of their file. It is meant to be minimalistic and only contain features that a reader would want; it is not meant to be a full file editor.

Functionality:

A user can open a file to read in their browser. The application will not save that file as data.

The application will save the bookmarks that a user has created into cache.

It will offer the user a way to save the pdf with a bookmark embedded as well.

The bookmarks will have a graphical design. Users can upload images to use as bookmarks or use some of the premade ones.

Allow users to highlight text and add notes to sections.

Create a bookmark organization structure.

Users can search for their bookmarks.

Export/Import bookmark functionality.

Dark mode.

Undo/Redo bookmarks.
